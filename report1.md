Architectural Blueprint and Feasibility Analysis for a Telegram-Backed Cloud Storage SystemSection 1: Architectural Blueprint for a Telegram-Backed Storage SystemThe endeavor to construct a personal cloud storage service, akin to Google Drive, utilizing the Telegram platform as a backend presents a unique set of architectural challenges. This section establishes the foundational design principles, examines proven patterns from existing implementations, and proposes a robust high-level architecture. The primary objective is to create a system that is not only functional but also aligns with the core user motivation of trust, control, and transparency.1.1 Conceptual Framework: Abstracting a Chat into a File SystemThe fundamental challenge in this architecture lies in the impedance mismatch between the source and target domains. Telegram's backend is, at its core, a chronological, linear stream of messages within a chat context. It is optimized for communication, not for the hierarchical, random-access nature of a modern file system.1 Therefore, the principal architectural task is the creation of a sophisticated abstraction layer that can translate this message stream into a structured, navigable hierarchy of files and folders.A viable system capable of this translation must be composed of three distinct, logically separated layers:Storage Abstraction Layer (SAL): This layer is the system's direct interface to the Telegram platform. Its sole responsibilities are to handle the low-level mechanics of the Telegram API for sending data (uploading file parts) and receiving data (downloading file parts). It manages authentication, connection state, rate-limit compliance, and error handling related to network operations.Metadata Management Layer (MML): This is the system's "brain." It maintains the logical structure of the entire file system, including directory trees, filenames, file versions, user permissions, and, most critically, the mapping between logical files and their constituent data chunks stored as messages in Telegram. Attempting to manage this complex relational data within Telegram itself would be grossly inefficient and would not scale.Presentation Layer (PL): This is the user-facing component of the system. It exposes the abstracted file system to the end-user or other applications. This could manifest as a web-based graphical user interface (GUI), a desktop client application, or a standardized access protocol such as Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning (WebDAV), which allows the storage to be mounted as a local drive.31.2 Architectural Patterns from Existing ImplementationsAnalysis of existing open-source projects that leverage Telegram for storage reveals several distinct architectural patterns. These real-world examples provide invaluable guidance on proven strategies and their respective trade-offs.The "UnLim" Model (Interface to Saved Messages): The application 'UnLim' exemplifies the most straightforward architectural model. It functions as a specialized client for a user's personal "Saved Messages" chat on Telegram, presenting it as a file repository.4 While simple to implement, this approach is inherently limited. It is a single-user utility, lacks a sophisticated metadata structure, and cannot easily support features like file sharing, versioning, or complex folder hierarchies without placing a significant and inefficient parsing burden on the client application.The "Pentaract" Model (Database-Backed Metadata): A more robust and scalable architecture is demonstrated by the Pentaract project. This model utilizes a dedicated private Telegram channel purely for storing file data. Crucially, it offloads all metadata management to an external, self-hosted PostgreSQL database.2 This database stores the file and folder hierarchy, maps logical files to their constituent chunks (individual Telegram messages), and manages user access controls. This separation of concerns is a classic pattern in distributed storage systems, allowing for fast, indexed queries on the metadata (e.g., "list all files in this directory") without needing to interact with the much slower blob storage (Telegram).2The "tgfs" Model (Git-Backed Metadata & WebDAV): The tgfs project introduces an innovative variation on the external metadata pattern. Instead of a traditional database, it uses a Git repository to store and manage the file system's structure.3 Each file and folder in the logical file system is represented by an entry in the Git repository, which contains the metadata pointing to the actual data chunks in Telegram. This approach offers natural, robust versioning for every file system operation and leverages a widely understood tool for conflict resolution. Furthermore, tgfs exposes the storage via a WebDAV server, enabling seamless integration with a vast ecosystem of existing desktop and mobile client applications.3The "TelegramAsDatabase" Model (Key-Value Store): While not a file system, the TelegramAsDatabase project provides relevant architectural patterns. It abstracts a Telegram channel into a generic, asynchronous key-value database, suitable for storing structured data as messages.5 Its implementation of atomic transactions, bulk operations, and a resilient retry policy for message-based data manipulation offers valuable lessons for how to reliably manage metadata entries if one were to attempt a hybrid storage model.1.3 Proposed High-Level ArchitectureTo satisfy the user's requirement for a trustworthy and feature-rich "Google Drive" equivalent, a hybrid architecture drawing inspiration from the Pentaract and tgfs models is recommended. This design prioritizes scalability, feature-completeness, and adherence to best practices in distributed systems design.Backend Storage: A dedicated, private Telegram channel will serve as the raw "block storage" for file data. This channel will contain nothing but the raw, encrypted file chunks, treated as immutable blobs.API Interaction: A core service worker, authenticating as a full Telegram user account via the MTProto protocol, will be the sole component responsible for all interaction with the Telegram API. This worker will handle the upload and download of file chunks.Metadata Store: A lightweight, self-hosted relational database will manage all file system metadata. SQLite is recommended for initial development and simple, single-user deployments due to its ease of setup. PostgreSQL is the recommended path for scalability, offering superior performance and concurrency for multi-user or high-load scenarios. This database is the "source of truth" for the file system's structure.Presentation & Access: A custom web application will provide the primary, user-friendly interface for file management. This will be supplemented by an optional WebDAV endpoint, allowing power users to mount the storage as a network drive on their desktop operating systems for direct integration with other applications.Security Paradigm: A zero-knowledge security model will be enforced. All files will be encrypted on the client-side before the first byte is transmitted to the API interaction layer. This ensures that the data stored on Telegram's servers is indecipherable to Telegram itself, fulfilling the core requirement of trust. This is explored in detail in Section 4.The decision to separate the data plane (file chunks in Telegram) from the control plane (metadata in a database) is not an optional refinement; it is a fundamental architectural necessity. A system that attempts to infer the file system structure by reading and parsing messages from a Telegram channel will inevitably fail due to poor performance, excessive API calls leading to rate-limiting, and an inability to implement complex features efficiently. The proposed architecture establishes a robust foundation for building a high-performance, feature-rich, and trustworthy personal cloud storage platform.Section 2: The Crucial API Decision: MTProto (TDLib) vs. Bot APIThe selection of the appropriate Telegram Application Programming Interface (API) is the single most critical technical decision in this project. It dictates the fundamental capabilities, performance limits, and ultimate viability of the application as a file storage solution. A detailed comparative analysis reveals that while Telegram offers two distinct APIs, only one is suitable for this demanding use case.2.1 Understanding the Two APIsTelegram provides two primary methods for programmatic interaction with its platform, each designed for vastly different purposes.The Bot API: This is a high-level, simplified interface that operates over HTTPS.6 It is designed specifically for creating chat bots. When a developer sends a request to the Bot API, they are communicating with an intermediary server managed by Telegram. This server then translates the simple web request into the more complex, underlying MTProto protocol to communicate with Telegram's core infrastructure.7 It is designed for ease of use and rapid development of interactive, message-based applications.The MTProto API: This is the core, low-level, and highly optimized protocol that all official Telegram clients (Desktop, Android, iOS) use to communicate directly with Telegram's data centers.6 It is a sophisticated, stateful protocol built for high performance and security. Interacting with the MTProto API allows an application to function as a full-fledged, custom Telegram client, with access to the complete range of features available to a normal user. Libraries such as the Telegram Database Library (TDLib), Pyrogram, and Telethon provide developer-friendly wrappers that abstract away the immense complexity of the raw MTProto protocol.72.2 Comparative Analysis: A Technical KnockoutWhen evaluated against the specific requirements of a file storage application, the Bot API's limitations render it entirely unsuitable, while the MTProto API emerges as the only viable choice.File Size Limits: This is the most significant and non-negotiable differentiator.Bot API: Is subject to severe file size restrictions imposed by the intermediary server. It can only download files up to 20 MB and upload files up to a maximum of 50 MB.7 These limits are hard-coded and make it impossible to store most modern media files, documents, or backups.MTProto API: Provides direct access to Telegram's full file handling capabilities, allowing for the upload and download of individual files up to 2 GB.7 Telegram Premium users may have this limit increased to 4 GB.14 This high limit is the fundamental enabler for a legitimate cloud storage service.Performance and Overhead:Bot API: The required round-trip through an additional HTTPS server introduces significant latency and acts as a performance bottleneck. The protocol itself, based on text-heavy JSON payloads, is less efficient than a binary protocol.7MTProto API: Communication is direct with Telegram's distributed data centers via a highly optimized binary protocol. This results in substantially lower latency, higher throughput, and reduced overhead, which is critical when transferring large files broken into many small chunks.7Rate Limiting and Control:Bot API: Is subject to a set of global and group-specific rate limits (e.g., no more than 20 messages per minute to the same group).15 These limits are not always clearly documented and can be difficult to manage programmatically, leading to unpredictable throttling.MTProto API: While also protected by anti-abuse mechanisms, it provides more granular and actionable feedback to the client. For instance, when a limit is exceeded, the API can return a specific FLOOD_WAIT_X error, instructing the client to wait for a precise number of seconds before retrying.16 This allows for the implementation of sophisticated, adaptive rate-limiting logic within the application. Furthermore, Premium accounts benefit from higher speeds and are less subject to throttling for large uploads.16Functionality and Access Level:Bot API: An application using this API operates as a "bot" entity. Bots have restricted permissions; they cannot create channels, and they have limited visibility into a chat's message history and member list.7 This makes it difficult or impossible to manage a private channel as a storage backend.MTProto API: An application using this API can authenticate and operate as a full "user" account. This grants it the same permissions as a human user, including the ability to create and administer private channels, and crucially, to access the complete message history of those channels to retrieve specific file chunks by their message ID.6To provide a clear, at-a-glance justification for this critical decision, the following table summarizes the key differences.FeatureBot APIMTProto APIImplication for Storage ApplicationMax Download Size20 MB 112 GB (Standard) / 4 GB (Premium) 12Disqualifying. The Bot API cannot handle moderately sized files.Max Upload Size50 MB 102 GB (Standard) / 4 GB (Premium) 12Disqualifying.

The MTProto API is the only technically viable path forward. This decision has a profound architectural implication: the application must be designed not as a simple, stateless bot, but as a full-featured, stateful custom Telegram client. This elevates the development complexity but is the sole means of unlocking the performance, file size capacity, and granular control necessary to build a robust system. The developer's mindset must shift from "building a bot" to "building a specialized client," which entails greater responsibility for managing connections, handling complex API responses, and intelligently navigating rate limits.Section 3: Implementing the Storage Layer: File Handling and MetadataHaving established the MTProto API as the necessary foundation, the implementation of the storage layer presents two core engineering challenges. The first is the reliable transfer of arbitrarily large files by breaking them into smaller pieces. The second, and more complex, is the creation of a robust, external system to manage the file system's metadata, which provides structure and meaning to the raw data stored in Telegram.3.1 File Chunking and ReassemblyWhile the MTProto API offers a generous 2 GB single-file limit, a professional-grade storage system must be designed to handle files of any size. Furthermore, a chunking strategy dramatically improves the reliability of transfers over unstable networks.The Necessity of Chunking: The process of splitting large files into smaller, manageable parts, known as chunking, is essential for two primary reasons. First, it is the only way to store files that exceed the API's 2 GB limit.13 Second, it enables resumable uploads and downloads. If a transfer of a 10 GB file fails at 99%, a monolithic approach would require restarting from the beginning. A chunk-based approach allows the system to resume by re-transmitting only the final, failed chunk, saving significant time and bandwidth.2Optimal Chunk Size Determination: The Telegram API itself provides guidance on an optimal chunk size. When handling large file uploads, the API internally splits the file into parts, with a maximum part size of 512 KB (524,288 bytes).16 The documentation notes that using this maximum part size is recommended to avoid excessive protocol overhead. Therefore, for optimal performance, the application's chunking logic should align with this, splitting files into chunks of 512 KB or a reasonably small multiple thereof.Implementation Logic: The workflow for managing chunked files is a closed loop involving the client, the metadata store, and the Telegram storage channel.Upload Process: The client application reads the source file from the user's local disk. It splits the file's byte stream into an ordered sequence of N chunks. It then iterates through this sequence, uploading each chunk as a separate document message to the private Telegram channel.Metadata Update: As each chunk is successfully uploaded, Telegram returns a unique message ID for that chunk. This is the critical piece of information that links the logical file to its physical storage. The application must update the external metadata store with an entry for the parent file, which includes an ordered list of the Telegram message IDs corresponding to each of its chunks. The Pentaract project's architecture provides a clear model for this database-driven mapping.2Download Process: To retrieve a file, the client first queries the metadata store to obtain the ordered list of message IDs for the requested file. It then iterates through this list, downloading the content of each message (each chunk) from Telegram in sequence. The downloaded chunks are appended to a file on the user's local disk, perfectly reassembling the original.This chunk-based methodology transforms Telegram from a simple file-sharing service into a content-addressable block storage system, with the external metadata store acting as the crucial index.3.2 Metadata Management StrategiesThe performance, scalability, and feature set of the entire application are dictated not by Telegram, but by the design of the external metadata management system. Storing metadata directly within the Telegram channel—for example, in message captions or a dedicated "index message"—is a fundamentally flawed approach. It is not scalable, as it would require fetching and parsing potentially thousands of messages just to perform a simple operation like listing a directory's contents. This would be unacceptably slow and would quickly trigger API rate limits.Two primary strategies for external metadata management have proven effective:Strategy 1: Relational Database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite)Implementation: This is the approach used by the Pentaract project.2 A well-designed relational database schema would include tables for files, folders, chunks, and users. A files table might contain columns such as file_id, filename, parent_folder_id, size, mimetype, creation_date, and owner_id. A separate chunks table would create a one-to-many relationship, linking a file_id to a telegram_message_id and an integer chunk_order to maintain the correct sequence.Advantages: This approach offers exceptional query performance, especially for operations required by a dynamic user interface (e.g., listing folder contents, searching for files by name, or checking permissions). It also provides the strong guarantees of ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance, ensuring the integrity of the file system's structure.Disadvantages: It introduces an additional service that must be deployed, managed, and backed up.Strategy 2: Version Control System (e.g., Git)Implementation: This innovative strategy is employed by the tgfs project.3 The logical file system hierarchy is mirrored as a directory structure within a Git repository. Instead of containing actual data, the "files" within this repository are small text files (e.g., in YAML or JSON format) that hold the metadata, including the ordered list of Telegram message IDs for the corresponding file's chunks.Advantages: This method provides a complete, auditable history of every change to the file system for free, as versioning is a core feature of Git. Branching and merging workflows can be used for complex operations, and conflict resolution is handled by a mature, robust tool. The repository can be hosted for free on platforms like GitHub or GitLab.Disadvantages: Git is optimized for managing source code, not for the high frequency of small, transactional writes typical of a file system. Operations like creating a new empty folder or renaming a file, which are trivial in a database, require a full commit and push cycle in Git, which can be comparatively slow. Listing the contents of a large directory might require cloning or pulling the entire repository, which does not scale well.Recommendation: For an application aiming to replicate the interactive, responsive experience of Google Drive, a relational database is the superior architectural choice. The performance of the user interface is directly tied to the speed of metadata queries. A database is purpose-built for such queries, whereas Git is not. The Git-based approach is a clever and powerful solution, but it is better suited for archival or backup use cases where write performance is less critical and a complete version history is the paramount concern.Ultimately, the user's perception of the system's "speed" will be shaped more by the responsiveness of the metadata layer than by the raw file transfer speed of Telegram. A snappy UI that can list thousands of files in a folder instantly (a fast database query) will feel faster than a system with slow directory listings (a slow Git operation), even if the latter has slightly higher download throughput. The engineering focus must therefore be on designing a highly efficient metadata schema and a resilient chunk transfer manager. In this architecture, Telegram is relegated to the role of a simple, "dumb" blob store; the application's intelligence and performance characteristics reside entirely within the custom-built metadata layer.Section 4: Building a Foundation of Trust: A Zero-Knowledge Encryption FrameworkThe primary motivation for this project is the creation of a storage system that is inherently trustworthy. This goal cannot be achieved by relying on Telegram's default security measures alone. While Telegram's standard cloud chat encryption is robust, protecting data in transit and at rest from external adversaries, Telegram itself maintains access to the encryption keys.17 To build a truly private system where the user has exclusive control over their data, a zero-knowledge architecture must be implemented.4.1 The Principle of Zero-KnowledgeIn the context of cloud storage, a "zero-knowledge" system is one where the service provider (in this case, Telegram) has zero cryptographic knowledge of the content of the files it stores.19 This is achieved by performing all encryption and decryption operations exclusively on the client-side—that is, on the user's own device—before any data is transmitted to the server. The server only ever receives and stores opaque, indecipherable blobs of encrypted data. The open-source tgbox project is designed around this fundamental principle of user-controlled, client-side encryption.14 By adopting this model, the user is not required to trust Telegram with the confidentiality of their files; they only need to trust it to store the encrypted blobs and not lose them.4.2 Implementing Client-Side Encryption with PythonA secure and correct implementation of cryptography is notoriously difficult. It is imperative to use a modern, well-vetted, high-level cryptographic library that abstracts away dangerous low-level primitives and promotes safe usage patterns.Recommended Library: cryptographyThe cryptography package is the de facto standard for cryptographic operations in Python. It is actively maintained by a team of experts, provides high-level "recipes" that are difficult to misuse, and is widely regarded as the most secure choice for application developers.21Symmetric Encryption with Fernet:For encrypting the bulk file data, symmetric encryption (where the same key is used for encryption and decryption) is the most performant option. The Fernet specification, provided by the cryptography library, is an ideal choice.22 Fernet is a high-level recipe that combines AES-128 in CBC mode for confidentiality with a SHA256-based HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for authenticity.23 This is crucial, as it not only keeps the data secret but also prevents an attacker from tampering with the ciphertext without detection.Key Derivation from User Password:A user's password should never be used directly as an encryption key. Passwords chosen by humans typically have low entropy and are vulnerable to dictionary attacks. A Key Derivation Function (KDF) must be used to transform a memorable password into a cryptographically strong key.Recommended KDF: Scrypt. The cryptography library provides a robust implementation of Scrypt. A KDF is a deliberately slow algorithm that takes two inputs: the user's password and a unique, random value called a "salt." It performs a computationally intensive process to generate a secure key.24 The use of a unique salt per user ensures that even if two users choose the same password, their derived encryption keys will be completely different.The End-to-End Encryption Workflow:User Login/Session Start: The user provides their master password to the client application.Salt Retrieval: The application retrieves the user's unique salt from the metadata database. For a first-time user, a new, cryptographically secure random salt is generated and stored in the database alongside their user profile.In-Memory Key Derivation: The Scrypt KDF is invoked on the client-side, using the user's password and the retrieved salt as inputs. The output is the master encryption key, which exists only in the client application's memory for the duration of the session. This key is never stored on disk or transmitted over the network.File Encryption (Upload): Before a file chunk is uploaded, it is encrypted locally using Fernet with the in-memory master key. The resulting ciphertext is the data that is sent to the Storage Abstraction Layer for transmission to Telegram.File Decryption (Download): After an encrypted chunk is downloaded from Telegram, it is decrypted locally using Fernet with the same in-memory master key before being written to the reassembled file on the user's disk.Session End: When the user logs out or the session terminates, the in-memory master key is securely wiped from memory.4.3 Key Management and Security ConsiderationsThe implementation of a zero-knowledge system fundamentally shifts the locus of control and responsibility to the user.The Golden Rule of Data Recovery: The user's password becomes the sole key to their digital kingdom. There can be no "forgot password" feature that allows for data recovery. If the password is lost, the input to the KDF is lost forever. Since the KDF is a one-way function, the master encryption key cannot be regenerated, and all data encrypted with it becomes permanently and irrecoverably inaccessible.25 The application's user interface must communicate this reality to the user in the clearest possible terms. This is not a bug or a limitation; it is the logical and necessary consequence of a zero-knowledge design.Salt Management: The salt is not a secret. It is a public, non-secret value that must be stored in the metadata database. Its purpose is purely to prevent pre-computation attacks (like rainbow tables) and to ensure key uniqueness.Metadata Encryption: For the highest level of privacy, sensitive fields within the metadata database, such as filenames and folder names, should also be encrypted using the same derived master key. This ensures that even an adversary who gains access to the metadata database cannot learn the structure or naming convention of the user's files. Non-sensitive metadata, like file sizes or modification timestamps, can remain in plaintext to facilitate queries.This client-side encryption framework provides absolute security and privacy, fulfilling the user's core requirement for a system they can trust completely. However, this absolute security comes at the cost of user-friendly recovery options. The user is making a conscious trade-off, exchanging the convenience of managed recovery for absolute control and sovereignty over their data. This is a critical product design decision that must be embraced and clearly communicated throughout the user experience.Section 5: Selecting the Right Tools: Python Library EcosystemThe implementation of the MTProto API interaction layer is a complex task. The choice of the right Python library is therefore critical, as it will significantly influence development velocity, long-term code maintainability, and the overall stability of the application. The Python ecosystem offers two mature and powerful libraries for this purpose.5.1 The Contenders: Pyrogram vs. TelethonBoth Pyrogram and Telethon are high-level, asynchronous Python libraries designed to interact with the core MTProto API. They are the preeminent choices for building custom Telegram clients in Python and are far superior to attempting to implement the complex MTProto protocol from scratch.7 Both libraries effectively abstract the low-level details of serialization, encryption, and network communication, allowing the developer to work with familiar Python objects and methods to send messages, manage channels, and transfer files.75.2 Comparative AnalysisWhile both libraries provide access to the full feature set of the MTProto API, they differ in their design philosophy, documentation style, and, most importantly, their current maintenance status.Ease of Use and Documentation:Pyrogram: Is often praised by the community for its modern, clean, and intuitive API design. Its documentation is generally considered well-structured and rich with clear, practical examples, making it potentially easier for new developers to get started.7 The library's approach can feel more streamlined and "Pythonic" to some developers.Telethon: As the more established library, Telethon is exceptionally powerful and feature-complete. Its documentation is exhaustive and technically deep, reflecting the library's maturity and comprehensive coverage of the MTProto API.26 While powerful, its API can sometimes feel more verbose or complex compared to Pyrogram's.Performance:Both libraries are built on Python's native asyncio framework, which makes them highly efficient for I/O-bound applications like this one. Performance for file transfers will almost certainly be limited by external factors—such as network latency, disk I/O speed, and Telegram's own API throttling—rather than any significant difference in the libraries' internal processing speed. No definitive public benchmarks exist to suggest one is meaningfully faster than the other for this specific use case.Community and Maintenance Status:This is the most critical point of differentiation and a major factor in the final recommendation. Community discussions from recent years have raised significant concerns that the original Pyrogram library is no longer being actively maintained.27 While a community fork named Kurigram has emerged to continue development, building a long-term project on a library with an uncertain maintenance future introduces considerable risk.27Telethon, in contrast, has a long and consistent history of active development and maintenance. It is a mature project with a stable community and a clear track record of updates to keep pace with changes in the Telegram API.5.3 RecommendationThe choice of a core dependency like an API client library is not merely a technical preference; it is a strategic decision about the long-term health and viability of the project. An application designed for personal data storage is, by its nature, a long-term endeavor. It will be critically dependent on its MTProto library to continue functioning as Telegram updates its platform.An unmaintained library will not receive updates to support new API features, security patches, or compatibility fixes for breaking changes in the protocol. This can lead to "bit rot," where the application ceases to function correctly over time. Given the community reports regarding the maintenance status of Pyrogram, building a new project on it carries a significant risk that the application could break after a future Telegram update, with no support or fixes available from the library's maintainers.Therefore, despite the potential appeal of Pyrogram's API design, Telethon is the more prudent and responsible engineering choice for this project. Its proven stability, maturity, and history of active maintenance provide a much lower-risk foundation. The long-term reliability of the chosen library is paramount, and in this regard, Telethon has a clear and decisive advantage.Section 6: Risk Analysis and Strategic Comparison with Professional Cloud StorageWhile the proposed architecture is technically feasible, a comprehensive analysis must extend beyond the technical implementation to include a rigorous assessment of the non-technical risks and a pragmatic comparison against established, professional cloud storage solutions. This section serves as a crucial reality check, enabling a fully informed decision about whether the benefits of zero-cost storage and absolute control outweigh the significant inherent risks and drawbacks of this unconventional approach.6.1 Legal and Policy Risk: The Terms of Service Grey AreaThe single greatest risk to the long-term viability of this project is not technical but political. It stems from the use of the Telegram platform in a manner for which it was not designed or intended.Telegram's Stated Purpose: Telegram's official Privacy Policy and Terms of Service (ToS) consistently describe the platform as a "secure and feature-rich messaging service".17 The feature of storing user data (messages, media, files) in the cloud is explicitly framed as a means to support this core messaging function, enabling seamless access across multiple devices without reliance on third-party backups.17The Absence of Explicit Prohibition: A thorough review of the current ToS reveals no clauses that explicitly forbid the use of the platform for bulk, automated file storage.17 The prohibitions listed in the ToS are primarily focused on preventing spam, scams, the promotion of violence, and the distribution of illegal content.28The Inherent "Off-Label" Use Risk: Despite the lack of an explicit ban, using Telegram as a programmatic file storage backend constitutes a quintessential "off-label" use of the service. The platform's infrastructure, business model, and terms are all oriented around messaging. Telegram reserves the right to update its ToS at any time.28 At any point in the future, with no warning, Telegram could unilaterally decide that this usage pattern constitutes system abuse or is economically unsustainable. Potential actions they could take include:Implementing much stricter API rate limits that render the application unusable.Programmatically identifying and deleting files stored via such applications.Temporarily or permanently banning the user account associated with the API access, resulting in the instantaneous and irreversible loss of all stored data.There is no Service-Level Agreement (SLA), no guarantee of service, and no legal recourse should Telegram decide to terminate this functionality. This policy risk is unquantifiable and represents a potential single point of failure for the entire system.6.2 Comparative Analysis: Telegram vs. Professional Cloud StorageTo contextualize the trade-offs, it is essential to compare the proposed Telegram-backed solution against two leading professional object storage services: Amazon S3, the industry standard, and Backblaze B2, a popular low-cost competitor.MetricTelegram BackendAWS S3 (Standard)Backblaze B2Storage Cost (per TB/month)$0 (Monetary)~$23 32~$6 33Egress Cost (per TB)$0~$90 (first 10TB) 34$0 (up to 3x stored data) 35Durability Guarantee (SLA)None99.999999999% (11 nines)Designed for 11 nines durabilityPerformance Guarantee (SLA)None (highly variable)Yes (low-latency, high-throughput)Yes (hot storage, low-latency)Rate LimitsUndefined, subject to changeWell-defined, high limitsWell-defined, generous free tier 35Terms of Service RiskExtreme. Off-label use, risk of account termination.None. Purpose-built for this use case.None. Purpose-built for this use case.Development OverheadVery High. Requires building a complex abstraction layer.Low. Mature SDKs and tools.Low. S3-compatible API and SDKs.Client-Side EncryptionUser's sole responsibility to implement.User's responsibility (tools available).User's responsibility (tools available).This comparison makes the trade-offs starkly clear. The Telegram approach exchanges a direct monetary cost for an extremely high level of risk and a massive increase in development and maintenance complexity.Cost: While Telegram is "free" in terms of dollars, its true cost lies in the developer's time and the unquantifiable financial risk of data loss. For personal-scale storage (e.g., 1 TB), Backblaze B2's cost is a nominal ~$6 per month, with data downloads being effectively free for most use cases.36 AWS S3 is more expensive, primarily due to its data egress fees, but is still predictable.38Reliability and Durability: This is the most significant technical difference. Professional services like S3 and B2 are architected from the ground up for extreme data durability. They replicate data across multiple physical facilities and provide contractual SLAs guaranteeing its safety.39 Telegram offers no such guarantee; its storage is a convenience feature for messaging, not a permanent archive.Performance and Scalability: S3 and B2 are designed for massive scale and predictable, low-latency performance. Telegram's performance is variable, not guaranteed, and subject to undocumented throttling mechanisms designed to protect the messaging service, not serve a high-performance storage workload.The analysis leads to a crucial reframing of the project's purpose. If the primary goal is the reliable, long-term storage of valuable data, the Telegram-as-backend approach is objectively and demonstrably inferior to professional, low-cost alternatives. Its value does not lie in its practicality as a storage solution. Instead, its true value lies in the learning experience it offers and the absolute control it provides over the software stack. It is best viewed not as a free alternative to cloud storage, but as an advanced, hobbyist project in distributed systems design and applied cryptography.Section 7: Synthesis and Final RecommendationsThis final section synthesizes the preceding analysis into a conclusive verdict and provides a clear, actionable path forward. The recommendation is nuanced, acknowledging the project's dual nature as both a potentially unreliable utility and a valuable educational exercise.7.1 Summary of FindingsTechnical Feasibility: The project is technically feasible, a fact substantiated by the existence of multiple open-source implementations that have successfully solved the core architectural challenges.2Core Architectural Requirements: A successful implementation is not trivial. It mandates the use of the low-level MTProto API, an external metadata store (preferably a relational database), a robust file chunking and reassembly mechanism, and a mandatory, well-implemented client-side encryption framework to meet the user's stated goals of performance, features, and trust.The Primary Trade-Off: The decision to pursue this project represents a significant strategic trade-off. The user gains a storage system with zero direct monetary cost and absolute control over the entire software stack. In exchange, they accept a very high and unquantifiable risk of total data loss due to the "off-label" use of the Telegram platform, coupled with a substantial and ongoing development and maintenance burden.7.2 Recommended Technology StackFor a developer undertaking this project, the following technology stack is recommended for its maturity, performance, and alignment with the architectural principles outlined in this report:Language: Python 3Telegram API Library: Telethon.26 Chosen for its stability, maturity, and active maintenance record, which presents a lower long-term risk compared to alternatives with uncertain maintenance statuses.Metadata Store: SQLite for initial development and personal, single-user deployments. A clear architectural path should be maintained to allow for migration to PostgreSQL if future needs require greater scalability or concurrent access.Encryption Library: cryptography.22 Specifically, using the Fernet high-level recipe for authenticated symmetric encryption of file data, and the Scrypt KDF for deriving a strong encryption key from a user-provided password.24Frontend & Access Protocol: A lightweight web framework such as Flask or FastAPI to serve a web-based user interface. This can be coupled with a WSGI/ASGI-compatible library like wsgidav to expose a WebDAV endpoint for desktop integration.Deployment: Docker. Containerizing the entire application (the web server, the API worker, and the database) will ensure portability, simplify deployment, and create a reproducible environment.7.3 Final Verdict and Strategic CounselThe final recommendation must be bifurcated, addressing the two distinct motivations a developer might have for pursuing this project.As a Production-Ready, Reliable Storage System: For the purpose of safely storing valuable, important, or irreplaceable data, using Telegram as a backend is strongly not recommended. The risk of data loss resulting from a change in Telegram's Terms of Service or undocumented anti-abuse measures is simply too high. For this use case, a far superior solution is to use a low-cost, professional object storage provider like Backblaze B2. By combining B2 with the exact same client-side, zero-knowledge encryption framework detailed in Section 4, the user can achieve the same level of trust and privacy with vastly superior reliability, performance, and peace of mind, for a minimal monetary cost (approximately $6 per terabyte per month).33As an Educational Project and an Exercise in Digital Sovereignty: As a hands-on project for a developer, this endeavor is highly recommended. It offers a profound and practical education in a wide range of advanced topics, including distributed systems design, asynchronous programming, low-level API integration, applied cryptography, and database architecture. For a developer who values the learning process, enjoys the challenge of building complex systems from unconventional components, and wishes to have complete control over their software—while accepting the inherent risks for storing non-critical data—this is a fascinating and deeply rewarding project to undertake.7.4 Phased Development RoadmapFor the developer proceeding with the project, a phased, iterative approach is recommended to manage complexity:Phase 1 (Core API Interaction & Proof of Concept):Set up a Telethon client application that can successfully authenticate as a user account.Implement the most basic functions: uploading a single, small file to a designated private channel and then downloading it back. This validates the core connection and authentication logic.Phase 2 (Metadata and Chunking Implementation):Design and create the initial SQLite database schema (tables for files, folders, chunks).Implement the file chunking logic to split a large file into 512 KB parts.Implement the upload workflow: upload each chunk and record its message ID and sequence in the database.Implement the download workflow: read the chunk list from the database and reassemble the file.Phase 3 (Zero-Knowledge Encryption Layer):Integrate the cryptography library.Implement the password-based key derivation using Scrypt and salt management.Modify the upload/download workflows from Phase 2 to encrypt each chunk before upload and decrypt it after download.Phase 4 (User Interface and Presentation):Build a minimal web interface using Flask or FastAPI.Implement basic UI functionality: list files and folders (by querying the database), trigger uploads, and initiate downloads.Phase 5 (Deployment and Hardening):Containerize the entire application stack using Docker and docker-compose.Implement robust error handling, logging, and a configuration system for API keys and database paths.(Optional) Add a WebDAV endpoint to allow mounting the storage as a network drive.
